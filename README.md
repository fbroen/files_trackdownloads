# Activities for shared file downloads, visible to all admins

Creates activities (visible to any administrator) for downloads of files that were shared with other users or a group. This app is based on the [Download Activity](https://github.com/nextcloud/files_downloadactivity) app by Joas Schilling. The main difference between both apps is that this app reports the activities to all users with administrative rights while the app of Joas Schilling reports the activities only to the user who shared the file.

The feature is controllable via the `A local shared file or folder was downloaded` setting on the personal page.
